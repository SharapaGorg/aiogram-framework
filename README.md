# Default layout for Telegram bot

### I am developing this repo so that anyone can use it as a framework or just find something useful in my structure or technology stack

## Features

Features of this repo as framework:
 - convenient and flexible structure
 - proven technology stack
 - logging data in the database
 - automatic update of user data (new user / last message with the bot)
 - division of functions by permissions (ordinary user / moderator)
 - well-thought-out database structure with the necessary tables (users/moderators/logs)

## Structure
